[This blog post](http://blog.kentarok.org/entry/2013/06/05/220449) reminds me of the book I read six months ago.

![Code Simplicity](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51W1yF1nI%2BL._SL160_.jpg)  
[Code Simplicity](http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/1449313892/takus-22/ref=nosim)

Altough I don't remember the exact sentences in the book, the author wrote something like that:

> The ultimate goal of software is to help people, and great software is a software that will continue to help people. However, continuing to help people is really difficult because the environment around our software is going to change. As a result, we must maintain our software for continuing to help people. That's why "Code Simplicity" is needed. We have to keep our code simple for maintaing it easily. 

This is very similar idea of the author of that blog, isn't it? In the context of web services, we can change the word 'help people' to 'create the value for customers' like that:

> The ultimate goal of software is to create the value for customers, and great software is a software that will continue to create the value for customers. However, continuing to create the value is really difficult because the environment around our software is going to change. As a result, we must maintain our software for creating the value for customers. That's why "Code Simplicity" is needed. We have to keep our code simple for maintaing it easily. 

Do you care for keeping your code simple? If you don't, you might have to pay the huge cost in the future. 

大した内容でもないので、なんとなく英語で書いてみた(読んだ本も英語だったので)。
