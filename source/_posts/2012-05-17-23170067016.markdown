title: How to Set Up New Macbook Air
---

I love the Macbook Air. This is by far the best computer I've ever used. Recently, I got new Macbook Air and set up it for development. This is a memo I used for set up.

## System Preferences

Some default preferences are not useful. I hope that these preferences become default on the next MacOSX. You should change some of them. The followings are examples:

- Keybord > Keyboard
    - Check *"Use all F1, F2, etc..."*
    - Modifier Keys -> Bind Caps Lock Key as Control Key
- Keyboard > User Dictionary
    - Uncheck smart quotes
- Security > Privacy
    - Check *"Require password immediately after sleep or screen saver begins"*
- Displays
    - Check *"Show displays in menu bar"*
- Dock
    - Check *"Automatically hide and show the Dock"*
- Date and Time
    - Time Zone -> Check *"Set time zone automatically using current location"*
    - Clock -> Check *"Show date"*
- Sharing
    - Edit *"Computer Name"* you like

## Install Desktop Applications

- AppStore
    - Xcode
    - YoruFukurou (Twitter Client)
    - Day One (Personal Diary)
    - Evernote
    - Skitch
    - Reeder (RSS Reader)
    - Growl
    - SourceTree
- Others
    - Command Line Tools for Xcode
    - iTerm2
    - Chrome
    - Firefox
    - LimeChat

    - Dropbox
    - KeePassX (Password Manager)
    - Mendeley (Paper Management Tool)
    - mi (Text Editor)

## Install Terminal Applications

Homebrew is a famous package manager for MacOSX. If you want to know it more, see [here](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/).

```
#!/bin/sh
 
# Install Homebrew
ruby -e "$(curl -fksSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/master/Library/Contributions/install_homebrew.rb)"
brew install \
         git \
         tmux \
         zsh \
```

## Install My Dotfiles

A lot of dot files like .vimrc, .zshrc, and .tmux.conf are needed for a comfortable terminal environment. I manages these files with github and clones it as necessary.

```
#!/bin/sh
 
chsh -s /bin/zsh
 
# setup my dotfiles & oh-my-zsh
git clone git://github.com/takus/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
~/.dotfiles/install/install.sh 
 
# Install Vim Plugins with vundle
~/.dotfiles/install/vim-bundle.sh 
 
# Install Perlbrew
~/.dotfiles/install/perlbrew.sh 
```
